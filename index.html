                <p class="texto-cajab1"><strong>FROM PREVIOUS PAGE</strong><br>son: "Gotta walk the district".</br>"Ehrhardt and her opponent, Republican Eamest Leonard, have been pounding the pavement to introduce themselves to voters in a re-drawn. District 107, which includes the north- em half of Oak Lawn, sections of cen tral and east Dallas, and a northern swath east of central expressway jutting up to the LBJ Freeway
                    Ehrhardt has picked up the endorse- ment of the political action committee of Lesbian/Gay Political Coalition of Dallas. Leonard received the endorse- ment of Log Cabin Republicans of Dallas.
                    The candidates get-out-the-vote efforts are kicking into high gear for election day. With statistics and maps of every square inch of the district, it seems, Ehrhardt plans to have an army of about 30 "poll pushers" at voting sites handing out pro-Ehrhardt litera- ture, in addition to running a phone bank to remind people to vote and coordinate transportation to the polls.
                    Ehrhardt said surprise its the most common response she gets when knocking on doors. Most people say they have never met their representa- tive in the Texas Legislature before, a situation which she said she finds frus-
                    trating, given her efforts to get out in the district.
                    Gay and lesbian issues will almost certainly be featured in the 1997 legisla- tive session. The Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas plans to offer several proposals, as well as to fight off expect- ed anti-gay bills</p>     
                <p class="lista-derecha"> ⬛&nbsp;&nbsp;Hate crimes. Both candidates for District 107 have pledged to support a hate crimes bill, which would stiffen criminal penalties for crimes motivated by religious, racial, or anti-gay preju dice. Leonard said he generally sup ports anti-crime measures. Ehrhardt is widely credited with being a leader in last session's attempt to pass a revised hate crimes bill, which narrowly failed in the House</p>
                <p class="lista-derecha1"> ⬛&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment Non-Discrimination Leonard opposes a gay civil rights bill to outlaw job discrimination against gays and lesbians, saying such mea- sures inevitably lead to "frivolous law- suits," but he has pledged a policy of</p>                  
            </div>
            <div class="cajab2">
                <div class="texto-cajab2">
                    <p>non-discrimination for his own staff. Ehrhardt supports the civil rights bill, arguing that employment security is one of the most important social justice questions facing the community. Observers say such a bill has no chance of passing during the Texas Legislature's next session.</p>
                    <p class="lista-derecha3">⬛&nbsp;&nbsp;ame-gender marriage. Leonard has said he would vote for a bill ban- ning same-gender marriage in Texas. He said he sees no need to expand the family code to provide state recognition for same-gender unions. Ehrhardt opposes the measure, which is expected to be introduced by anti-gay conserva- tives. Analysts expect a marriage bill forbidding same-gender unions to pass during the next legislative session. The question, they say, is how much anti- gay language will be included in the measure.</p>
                    <p class="lista-derecha4">⬛&nbsp;&nbsp;AIDS funding. Both candidates have said they support increased fund- ing for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, which provides HIV medica tions to low-income Texans, although Leonard stipulated that he would need to be convinced that the money was helping people and not "feeding the bureaucracy. Recent pharmaceutical advances, such as the protease inhibitors, have wildly escalated treat- ment costs and lobbyists say an addi- tional $14 million will be needed from the state to fully fund the Texas pro- gram.</p>
                    <p class="texto-abajoo">Given Ehrhardt's long history of involvement for gay and lesbian issues, many Democratic activists have expressed shock that the Log Cabin Republicans-Dallas have backed Leonard, endorsing the GOP candidate, hosting a fundraiser-reception for him and providing campaign volunteers.</p>
                    <p class="texto-abajoo1">"They [Log Cabin] really need to examine what their motivations are," said Peter Brooks, co-chair of the LGRI board. "If the Republicans control (the Texas House or Senate), we can kiss goodbye trying to get anything </p>
                    <p class="texto-abajoo2">through Brooks said Ehrhardt had a 100 per- cent voting record for gay issues, and cited her assistance during the last ses- sion and her persistence in lobbying other legislators to support the hate crimes bill.</p>
